The sendEvent files present in this folder are generated by node, edge and path coverage tool.

Explanation of Naming conventions:
----------------------------------

1) The generated nodecoverage send event files will follow the following convention,

     igstk<class name>_<nodecoverage>_test[number].xml
    
eg:
igstkPolarisTrackerTool_nodecoverage_test.xml
igstkPolarisTrackerTool_nodecoverage_test1.xml

There can be one or more files based on the state machines.

2) The generated edgecoverage send event files will follow the below convention.

    igstk<class name>_<edgecoverage>_test[_basispath<number>][test<number>].xml
   
eg:
igstkImageSpatialObjectRepresentation_edgecoverage_test_basispath1.xml
igstkImageSpatialObjectRepresentation_edgecoverage_test1.xml

There can be one or more number of files in both basispath.xml and test.xml patterns.

The basispath edgecoverage xml file contains the edges covered from the starting state usually idle state.
The test edgecoverage xml file contains the edges un-covered in the basispath file and which are not starting from the idle state.
